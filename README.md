###

<p align="left">World Generation:<br><br>1. Started out recursively modifying a grid to create landmasses.<br>2. Switched to Perlin Noise, a gradient noise algorithm, for generating more varied and natural-looking terrain.<br>3. Added octaves, persistence, and lacunarity to adjust and fine-tune the Perlin Noise output.<br>4. Generated a mesh representation of the terrain using the modified noise data.<br>5. Calculated UVs (texture coordinates) for mapping textures onto the mesh.<br>6. Faced the challenge of working within Unity's limitations, including the maximum number of vertices in a mesh.<br>7. Implemented a level of detail (LOD) system to optimize performance by reducing the vertex count for distant chunks.<br>8. Utilized a chunk system to generate terrain sections (chunks) dynamically around the viewer's position.<br>9. Addressed threading restrictions by using a queue of callbacks to perform actions on the main thread.<br><br>Flight Simulator:<br><br>1. Created a flight controller script attached to the viewer object in the land generator.<br>2. Implemented forces acting on the plane, including thrust, lift, and drag.<br>3. Fine-tuned the flight controller to achieve realistic flight dynamics.<br>4. Handled challenges such as air density calculations by manually adjusting controller values for a satisfactory flight experience.<br><br>Visual Enhancements and Additional Features:<br><br>1. Added colors and textures to the mesh to improve visual appeal.<br>2. Created a custom material using a custom-made shader to apply different textures based on terrain height.<br>3. Enhanced gameplay experience by incorporating controller support using Unity's input manager.<br>4. Implemented a heads-up display (HUD) to provide essential information to the player during gameplay.<br>5. Developed a respawn system for player convenience in case of crashes or restarts.<br>6. Other finishing touches and refinements were introduced to enhance the overall immersion and enjoyment of the flight simulator.</p>
